# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide data source information].

## Setup
1. Install dependencies by looking app.py file
2. Run the script:
                  python app.py


Project Structure
app.py: Main script containing the project code.
data (1).csv: Dataset file.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA section of the code explores the dataset, providing insights into its structure and characteristics.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature selection, and scaling.

Model Training
A linear regression model is trained on the preprocessed data.

Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error and R-squared metrics.

Visualizations
Visualizations, such as correlation matrices and scatter plots, are generated for better understanding.
